- Reference Avg. Score: GPA 3.1~3.8 (77~85.67)

### 📊 Grading Breakdown
*   **Lab Assignments (8 Labs $\times$ 7% each)**: **56%**
*   **Final Written Examination**: **30%** *(In-person, proctored exam covering core 5G & O-RAN theoretical principles)*

### 🔄 GitHub Lab Submission & Peer Review (Top 3) Policy

#### 1. Individual Git Versioning & Submission
For each of the **8 scheduled labs**, students are required to maintain a personal, dedicated **GitHub Repository**. 
*   **Requirements**: Students must document their entire implementation process, including full 5W1H logic, packet captures, CLI logs, topologies, and systematic troubleshooting logs.
*   **Friction & Integrity**: TAs will monitor **Git commit histories** to track incremental progress. Direct copy-pasting of large, monolithic AI-generated files without commit progression will be heavily penalized.
*   **Deadline**: 12:00 PM (Noon) on the Monday following the lab session. The repository branch must be locked to **Read-Only** after the deadline.

#### 2. Mutual Peer Review (Top 3 Recommendation)
To foster social learning, constructive friction, and peer-to-peer critique:
*   Following each lab deadline, every student must review their peers' public GitHub repositories.
*   **Top 3 Selection**: Each student must identify the **Top 3** peer repositories they found most exemplary.
*   **Justification**: For each selected peer, the reviewer must write a detailed peer review card outlining:
    1. *What specific qualities make this repository outstanding (e.g., exceptional scripting, elegant network parsing, or clear system diagrams)?*
    2. *What constructive improvement or follow-up experiment can be proposed for their setup?*

#### 3. Normalized Ranking Multiplier
Final lab scores are subjected to a peer-weighted ranking curve. The final grade for each lab is scaled according to your percentile class ranking (calculated from consolidated teacher, TA, and peer evaluation scores):

$$\text{Final Assignment Score} = \text{Raw Lab Grade} \times \text{Multiplier}$$

| Percentile Rank | Multiplier | Grading Band Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top 90% – 100%** | **$\times$ 1.0** | Exceptional clarity, original analysis, and active peer reviews. |
| **Top 80% – 89%** | **$\times$ 0.9** | Fully functional setup with good documentation and screenshots. |
| **Top 70% – 79%** | **$\times$ 0.8** | Completed core tasks with minor gaps in analysis or evidence. |
| **Others (<70%)** | **$\times$ 0.7** | Bare-minimum execution, late commits, or lack of peer evaluation effort. |
